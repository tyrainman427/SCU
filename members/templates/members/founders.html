          I am a born and raised native of Newington, CT. My genetic makeup is of Irish, African American	,  and
Native American descent . I graduated from Newington High School and later went on to teach 	for
Newington Public Schools. I never knew that I would teach at the very school where I experienced so
much joy. I was saddened when my teaching experience was overshadowed by racism, the exact
opposite of my expectations, first hand. We all know the American dark secret exists but when you	 a re
on the receiving end, it leaves a scar forever. I have made it my business to combat racial intolerance
through activism. I am a leader in the Black Lives Matter movement. I have brought many people
together of all races. I co-founded the Ally Collective and a festival celebrating community sustainability
and togetherness:CT Peace Fest. I was excited when the team at Silver City Uprising asked me to apply
for the chair position.
I graduated from Central Connecticut State University, Summa Cum Laude, with a Bachelor’s degree in
English, History, and Latin	. Maintaining a 3.95 cumulative GPA is an accomplishment I hold dear. 	I  also
received the Highest Achievement award in Foreign Language, Latin. I built my own special studies
program in Latin Literature and History, maintaining a 4.0 GPA in that program. My honor societies
include: The English Honor Society, Sigma Tau Delta, Professional Honor Society, and Alpha Lambda
Delta. In light of these achievements, there is nothing like being on the front lines for the economic
empowerment of the black community. I stand strong in those beliefs and refuse to be silenced.  Every
black life matters and until those words are uttered in the police department,until schools and
legislation take meaningful action on our behalf, I will always be on that battlefield.
I valued working as a student worker for Veteran Affairs	. Helping student veterans, assisting with
certifications for enrollment, helping with homework or other responsibilities.  As a student worker	,  my
most exciting experience was with the Veterans History Project	. I  interviewed veterans in their homes,
collecting  and  organizing photographs or pertinent documents, uploading and maintaining website
profiles of veterans, answering phones, working with faculty and various personnel, working with digital
tools, digitally formatting projects,	and lastly I organized a historical trip to	Antietam, WV as well as
Gettysburg, PA.
I now look forward to contributing to the success of Silver City Uprising.
